Reqube
======

Reqube is a hardware project created with an MSP430G2335 microcontroller and various peripherals. It allows for recycling bins to be weighed, identified,  and categorized according to their contents. This in turn, allows for some pretty sweet data collection. Originally, it pushed all data online so viewers could track their recycling behavior, but feel free to expand it to whatever it can fulfil.
